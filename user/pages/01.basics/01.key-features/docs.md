Settings API is a great tool, allows admin pages containing setting forms to be managed semi-automatically. To achieve the required options in WordPress themes is a great way to use option framework like Redux, Titan, OptionTree and so on, but they became nasty and egregious loading heavy-weight unnecessary component, that is culminated in sluggishness of site performance and loading time. 

To deal with the such a challenging issue, we developed our own option system built with Reactjs, that loads all the necessary setting option in backend, that  are crying need of every one page website. So, the day of option framework is over.
